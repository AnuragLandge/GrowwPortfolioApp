# GrowwPortfolioApp
I'll select Groww for creating a dummy app. Groww is a popular investment platform that allows users to invest in mutual funds, stocks, and other financial instruments.

Feature Selection
I will implement a feature that displays the user's portfolio summary, showing the total investment, current value, and overall profit/loss.

App Implementation
Frontend (Flutter, Dart)
I'll create a simple Flutter app that has a single screen displaying the portfolio summary.

Backend (TypeScript)
I'll set up a basic Express server in TypeScript that fetches dummy portfolio data from a PostgreSQL database.

Database (PostgreSQL)
I'll create a PostgreSQL database with a table to store the portfolio data.
